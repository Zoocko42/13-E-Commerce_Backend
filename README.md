# 13-E-Commerce_Backend
The backend models, routes, and databases for a hypothetical e-commerce website.

### User Guide

By entering the proper HTML address users can GET lists of categories, tags, or products, or they can enter the category ID, the tag ID, or the product ID as a parameter to GET the specified target; they can also use these same parameters to PUT an edit on existing categories, tags, or products, or to DELETE any of the above.  

The user can also POST a new category by posting a JSON containing the new category name to the categories API route, they can POST a new tag by posting a JSON containing the new tag name to the tags API route, and they can POST a new product by posting a JSON containing the product name, price, stock, category ID, and any relevant TagIds.
